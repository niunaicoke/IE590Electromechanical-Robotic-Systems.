It unlocks a vast range of applications, from facial recognition in security systems to identifying objects in self-driving cars. One of the key techniques for achieving real-time image recognition is through Haar cascade classifiers. These clever algorithms use small features to detect specific objects efficiently, making them ideal for tasks like face detection in videos or object tracking in real-world environments. While not the most advanced approach, Haar cascades offer a powerful and accessible introduction to the exciting world of image recognition.\n","\n","<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->\n","<img src=\"img/ImageRecognitionDevices.jpg\" alt=\"IphoneImageRecognition\" width=\"520\"/>\n","\n","<center><i>Facial recognition on an iPhone.</i></center>\n","<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->\n","\n","Haar cascade classifiers are a type of machine learning algorithm used for object detection in images and videos.

If an image fails a stage (doesn't meet the weak learner criteria), it's immediately rejected as a non-object, significantly reducing computation time.\n","Only images that pass all stages are classified as containing the target object.\n","Advantages:\n","\n","**Real-time processing:** The light-weight computational effort of running Haar cascade classifiers through grayscale images (only one matrix!) makes them suitable for video applications.\n","\n","**Pre-trained models available:** OpenCV library provides pre-trained Haar cascades for common objects like faces, eyes, and bodies.\n","\n","**Easy to implement:** Libraries like OpenCV offer functions to load and use pre-trained models.\n","\n","**Limitations:** Compared to modern deep learning techniques, Haar cascades may have lower accuracy. For example, Haar cascade classifiers can struggle with objects of very small size or with significant rotation.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","## Making a Haar Cascade Classifier\n","\n","This discussion will assume basic knowledge of boosting algorithms and weak vs. strong learners with regards to machine learning.\n","\n","The algorithm can be explained in four stages:\n","\n","- Calculating Haar Features\n","- Creating Integral Images\n","- Using Adaboost\n","- Implementing Cascading Classifiers\n","- It’s important to remember that this algorithm requires a lot of positive images of faces and negative images of non-faces to train the classifier, similar to other machine learning models.\n","\n","## Calculating Haar Features\n","\n","The first step is to collect the Haar features. A Haar feature is essentially calculations that are performed on adjacent rectangular regions at a specific location in a detection window.

This is where integral images come into play because the number of operations is reduced using the integral image.\n","\n","## Creating Integral Images\n","\n","Without going into too much of the mathematics behind it (check out the paper if you’re interested in that), integral images essentially speed up the calculation of these Haar features. Instead of computing at every pixel, it instead creates sub-rectangles and creates array references for each of those sub-rectangles. These are then used to compute the Haar features.\n","\n","<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->\n","<img src=\"img/HaarScanningImage.jpg\" alt=\"HaarScanningImage\" width=\"320\"/>\n","\n","<center><i>Illustration for how an integral image works.</i></center>\n","<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->\n","\n","It’s important to note that nearly all of the Haar features will be irrelevant when doing object detection, because the only features that are important are those of the object. However, how do we determine the best features that represent an object from the hundreds of thousands of Haar features? This is where Adaboost comes into play.\n","\n","## Adaboost Training\n","\n","Adaboost essentially chooses the best features and trains the classifiers to use them. It uses a combination of “weak classifiers” to create a “strong classifier” that the algorithm can use to detect objects.\n","\n","Weak learners are created by moving a window over the input image, and computing Haar features for each subsection of the image. This difference is compared to a learned threshold that separates non-objects from objects. Because these are “weak classifiers,” a large number of Haar features is needed for accuracy to form a strong classifier.\n","\n","<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->\n","<img src=\"img/Adaboost.jpg\" alt=\"Adaboost\" width=\"520\"/>\n","\n","<center><i>Representation of a boosting algorithm.</i></center>\n","<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->\n","\n","## Implementing Cascading Classifiers\n","\n","<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->\n","<img src=\"img/HaarTraining.jpg\" alt=\"HaarTraining\" width=\"520\"/>\n","\n","<center><i>A flowchart of cascade classifiers.</i></center>\n","<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->\n","\n","The cascade classifier is made up of a series of stages, where each stage is a collection of weak learners. Weak learners are trained using boosting, which allows for a highly accurate classifier from the mean prediction of all weak learners.\n","\n","Based on this prediction, the classifier either decides to indicate an object was found (positive) or move on to the next region (negative). Stages are designed to reject negative samples as fast as possible, because a majority of the windows do not contain anything of interest.\n","\n","It’s important to maximize a low false negative rate, because classifying an object as a non-object will severely impair your object detection algorithm. A video below shows Haar cascades in action. The red boxes denote “positives” from the weak learners.\n","\n","Haar cascades are one of many algorithms that are currently being used for object detection. One thing to note about Haar cascades is that it is very important to reduce the false negative rate, so make sure to tune hyperparameters accordingly when training your model.\n","\n","## Haar Cascades in Code\n","\n","```\n","import numpy as np\n","import cv2 as cv\n","f_cascade = cv.CascadeClassifier(\"face.xml\")\n","e_cascade = cv.CascadeClassifier(\"eye.xml\")\n","image = cv.imread(\"actor.jpg\")\n","gray = cv.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n","faces = f_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.3, 5)\n","for (x,y,w,h) in faces:\n","    img = cv.rectangle(img,(x,y),(x+w,y+h),(255,0,0),2)\n","    roi_gray = gray[y:y+h, x:x+w]\n","    roi_color = img[y:y+h, x:x+w]\n","    eyes = e_cascade.detectMultiScale(roi_gray)\n","    for (ex,ey,ew,eh) in eyes:\n","        cv.rectangle(roi_color,(ex,ey),(ex+ew,ey+eh),(0,255,0),2)\n","\n","plt.imshow(img) # display resulting image\n","plt.xticks([]),plt.yticks([])\n","plt.show()\n","```\n","\n","<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->\n","<img src=\"img/Recognition.jpg\" alt=\"Recognition\" width=\"320\"/>\n","\n","<center><i>Output of the above code.</i></center>\n","<!--%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%-->\n","\n","Implementing this into code is surprisingly easy using OpenCV’s CascadeClassifier function. As you can see here, this model is surprisingly accurate in detecting both eyes and faces. What’s even more incredible is that the Haar classifier can be used to identify any object given enough training images to run upon.\n","\n","\n","## Applications of Haar Cascades\n","\n","The applications of this technology are enormous in a variety of different fields. A few of the most important applications are listed below:\n","\n","- **Facial Recognition:** Similar to how iPhone X uses facial recognition, other electronic devices and security protocols can use Haar cascades to determine the validity of the user for secure login.\n","- **Robotics:** Robotic machines can “see” their surroundings to perform tasks using object recognition. For instance, this can be used to automate manufacturing tasks.\n","- **Autonomous Vehicles:** Autonomous vehicles require knowledge about their surroundings, and Haar cascades can help identify objects, such as pedestrians, traffic lights, and sidewalks, to produce more informed decisions and increase safety.\n","- **Image Search and Object Recognition:** Expanding off facial recognition, any variety of objects can be searched for by using a computer vision algorithm, such as Haar cascades.\n","- **Agriculture:** Haar classifiers can be used to determine whether harmful bugs are flying onto plants, reducing food shortages caused by pests.\n","- **Industrial Use:** Haar classifiers can be used to allow machines to pick up and recognize certain objects, automating many of the tasks that humans could previously only do.\n","\n","Haar cascades and relevant computer vision technology will undoubtedly create a huge impact in the economy and ML world.
